<h1 style="text-align:center">Smooth Handfish</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">The smooth handfish had quite an unusual look. With its bulging eyes and mohawk-like fins, the smooth handfish was anything but a common fish.<br> We just knew we had to have it! So we added it to our collection in 2020.</p>
