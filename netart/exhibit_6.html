<h1 style="text-align:center">Mountain Gorilla</h1>
<p style="text-align:center"> The Virunga Landscape has a history of political instability along with high levels of poverty in the region. This posed substantial threat to mountain gorilla numbers as people have moved into areas closer to these great apes for food, shelter and space. They almost evaded capture with conservation efforts from both local and international organization to repopulate. Thankfully, due to multiple threats hindering recovery progress we were able to add this species to our menagerie in 2034.  </p>
