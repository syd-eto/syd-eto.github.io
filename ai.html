  <h1>Family History</h1> 
   <p>I created these images in the spirit of Thanksgiving. It's one of the few times my grandpa will talk about the struggle my family went through when they first emigrated to<br> America. The reason being that my great grandfather expressed a wish for our family to let go of the past and look toward the future despite all of the pain he had been<br> through. I chose the Midjourney Ai generator to express my family history because it was a good metaphor for how our perceptions of events are colored by our<br> upbringings. My family fed me information about our past and that in turn created pain and resentemnt in me for events that I never experienced myself. And I was taught<br> forgive and look forward by a man I never met. Incidentally, I never told the Ai generator to have the subjects looking out toward the horizon. It did that on it's own.<br><br><br><p/>

One of them went to the south, the other to washington settling down is Seattle, and my great great grandfather purchased land in San Luis <br>Obispo to start farming.<br><br><br><p/>
